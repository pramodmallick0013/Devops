networking 
it is a connection between two or more machine to communicate with each other.


networking concepts

nic(network interface card or controller)---lan adapter,n/w adapter

computer to computer connects with network (hardware component)

each nic will be having a unique mac address(media access control address)

to avoid the conflicts between same nic adapters or lan adapters.

in linux these nic adapters is represented by the word

"eth0"

e.g.

if there are two ethernet adapters it will be denoted by eth0,eth1



media
medium via which two different computer's nic card will be connected.
media is a  cable
e.g.
rj45,cat5,cat6


protocol

rules and regulations for communication between network devices.


packet switching tehniques  (to send and receive messages in the form packets)

tcp/ip(transmission control protocol over internet protocol)
connection oriented
reliable 
acknowledgement will be sent/received)
6
http,ftp,smtp uses tcp

udp(user datagram protocol)
connectionless
non reliable
no acknowledgement
17
dns,dhcp uses udp


ip address

(phone number) unique


ip address classes
subnet mask
gateway




ip address classes

A,B,C,D,E


class 	start 		end 			default subnet mask 	cidr
A	0.0.0.0		127.255.255.255		255.0.0.0		/8
B	128.0.0.0	191.255.255.255		255.255.0.0		/16
(WAN & MAN)

LAN
C	192.0.0.0	223.255.255.255		255.255.255.0		/24

R & D
D(muticast)(email)	224.0.0.0	239.255.255.255	
E(reserved)	240.0.0.0	255.255.255.255
classless inter domian routing

127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 is reserved for loopback address

loopback address

special ip number (127.0.0.1) that is designed for the purpose for the software loopback interface of a machine.

internal testing on local machines


multicast
it allows a single message to be sent to a group of receipients

emailing,teleconferencing

is uses network infrastructure and standards to send messages.


subnet mask or netmask

it allows users to identify which part of an ip address is reserved for the network and 
which part is available for host use.
cidr users can not tell which part of the address is which ..

it gives users all the information needed to calculate the network  and host 

ip address



1 byte 8 bit



netmask   		255 		255		 255 		0
binary			11111111	11111111	11111111	00000000
netmask length		8		16		24		





gateway
network point that provides entrance into another network

on the internet

a node or stopping point can be either gateway or a host (end-point) node.

e.g.

192.168 send a file to 10.10

we required a gateway to communicate  between two computers of different network.
